UIUCCourseCheck
===============

A simple desktop app for easily checking UIUC Course Availability

Simply input the courses that you want to receive updates on in the INPUT COURSES HERE.txt in the proper format to receive availbility info on those courses.

If I were to work on this again, I would certainly not do it in with Zen.java for the GUI. I would much rather use something like Swing.

The application updates itself every 5 minutes so you can catch that class as soon as a spot opens!

You can download just the application from here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zj5vu81jk2ixpcd/iYTuzOoX_w
